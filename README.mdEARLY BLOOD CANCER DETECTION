EARLY BLOOD CANCER DETECTION
Project Overview: Early Blood Cancer Detection Using AI (MATEO TL microscope)
DOMAIN :
..Healthcare & MedicaL Diagnostics
	•Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Technologies Used:1.Machine Learning & AI Frameworks:	
•TensorFlow, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data (if applicable
2.Big Data Platforms (Optional):
•kaggle data set 
3.Data Visualization:
	•Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly for interactive data visualizations	•SHAP or LIME for model interpretable 

Problems :
Imbalanced Data:
Blood cancer cases, especially early-stage ones, are rare compared to the general population. This can result in imbalanced datasets, leading to models that are biased towards predicting the absence of cancer.
Solution:
Cross-validation and Generalization:
Employ cross-validation strategies and test the model on multiple independent datasets. Use techniques like domain adaptation or domain generalization to improve model performance across different populations.

DOMAIN ADAPTATION,GENERALIZATION
Domain adaptation is the technique of transferring a machine learning model trained on data from one domain to effectively work on data from a different but related domain.
Domain generalization is a technique where a machine learning model is trained to perform well across multiple, diverse domains, aiming to generalize its performance to new, unseen domains.
